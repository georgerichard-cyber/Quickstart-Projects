# Quickstart-Projects
Collection of my work - George Richard 
I am very interested in entering the Cybersecurity field; I took Quickstart's Virtual Bootcamp recently and am using these repositories to display my learnings.
One file shown has my code for a port scanner for TCP ports, ranging from 0-1025 and checking their open vs closed status. It works extremely fast, and any open ports that are discovered get marked via a text file.
The other file is a video demonstration displaying modifications I've made to a network and its security settings; I show virtual machines and their settings, the scans and exploits I use, firewall traffic settings, and SNORT alerts meant to track the exploits.
