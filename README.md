# Quickstart-Projects
Collection of my work - George Richard

As someone interested in entering the Cybersecurity field, I have recently taken Quickstart's Virtual Bootcamp and am using these repositories to showcase my learnings.

I have included my source code for a port scanner that checks if TCP ports are open versus closed, ranging from 0-1025. This program works very quickly, and it creates a text file that highlights any open ports that it finds.

The other file shows a video demonstration of changes I've made to a network and its security settings; I show virtual machines and their settings, the scans and exploits I use, firewall traffic settings, and SNORT alerts meant to track the exploits shown. The raw file is contained in the repository, which can also be viewed via my drive at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CzSF9DdmPqXJSnLhkHeEGpC1o4M41bNl/view?usp=sharing
